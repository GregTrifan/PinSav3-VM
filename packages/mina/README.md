# Mina zkApp: PinSave

Pin Save is a decentralized social media which consists of decentralized posts enabled by Mina blockchain and o1js. The speed of interacting with media and content should be greatly enhanced by storing metadata off-chain enabled by Mina merkle trees. In addition, it aims to introduce more standards into the Mina ecosystem related to non fungible tokens to improve developer experience.
